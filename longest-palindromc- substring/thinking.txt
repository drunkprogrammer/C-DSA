First time, I didn't know the meaning of 'palindromic ', so I translated the word by online tool,
finding the word meaning as same as 'recurrent'. Palindromic is one requirement. The longest substring is another requirement. To satisfy palindromic is more easier than the longest substring. You just need to find the index of substring char as the same as  the current element in origin string by using c++ function --'find()'. The length of substring we need to record for compare with next substring length.
